\chapter{Contributing}\label{s:contributing}

Contributions of all kinds are welcome, from errata and minor improvements to
entirely new sections and chapters: please
\href{mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com}{email us} or submit an issue or pull
request to \href{https://github.com/software-tools-in-javascript/js4ds/}{our
  GitHub repository}. Everyone whose work is incorporated will be acknowledged;
please note that all contributors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct
(\appref{s:conduct}).  Please note that we use Simplified English rather than
Traditional English, i.e., American rather than British spelling and grammar. We
encourage translations; if you would like to take this on, please
\href{mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com}{email us}.

If you wish to report errata or suggest improvements to wording, please include
the chapter name in the first line of the body of your report (e.g., \texttt{Testing\ Data\ Analysis}).
